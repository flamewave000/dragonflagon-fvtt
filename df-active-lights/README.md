This module provides a way to animate all the various configurations of a light. This animation will be synchronized with the server so that all players should see the same animation states. A simple example for this would be for creating a simple Light House where the light's direction would animate all the way around a 180Â° rotation. The configuration window for Active Lights can be opened from the Light Animation tab in any Ambient Light config window.

## Animation Functions

The way animations work is that at time T, the position along the transition is at a deterministic position along a mathematical curve. This is some really fancy talk for basically making a dot follow a line.

Take this animation for example:
- Key Frame: 0 Seconds
	- Bright Radius: 0 feet
- Key Frame: 2 Seconds
	- Bright Radius: 40 feet

Given a Linear animation, the following are the results over time:
|0s|0.25s|0.5s|0.75s|1s|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0 ft|10 ft|20 ft|30 ft|40 ft|

The same key frames but with an Elliptic Animation would have these results:
|0s|0.25s|0.5s|0.75s|1s|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0 ft|15.31 ft|28.28 ft|36.96 ft|40 ft|

Here are all of the animation functions that are available, along with a graph for each.
