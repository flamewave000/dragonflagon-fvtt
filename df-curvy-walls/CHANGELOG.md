## Release 3.2.1 (2021-08-09)
- License Migration.

## Release 3.2.0 (2021-06-27)
- Added settings option for the key held for doing quick tool placement.
- Changed the quick tool placement key to Alt by default instead of Ctrl.
- Restored the ability to hold the Ctrl key while Click+Dragging the tool onto the canvas. This allows you to easily start from an existing wall segment's end node.
- Added compatibility with the [Button Overflow](https://github.com/ardittristan/VTTButtonOverflow) module. The toggles will now move to the right to make room for the wrapped scene controls.

## Release 3.1.0 (2021-06-06)
- Migrated to FoundryVTT 0.8.6

## Release 3.0.1 (2021-05-27)
- Japanese Locale update courtesy of Touge, Brother Sharp.
- Small optimization in the controls template.

## Release 3.0.0 (2021-05-04)
- Moved controls to the right of the wall selectors. This prevents the buttons going offscreen for those with a smaller monitor size. This also required me to overhaul the controls, and they are now more reliable and have a simpler implementation.
- Adjusted the Enabled look of the toggleable controls to be more visually apparent that they are selected.
- Added a way to place/move the most recent configuration for a given active tool to a specific point by `Ctrl + LeftClick` a location on the canvas.
- Made the tool Control Points a little bit larger to be more easily clicked when zoomed out.
- The current tool state and placement will be preserved when you switch away from the Walls Layer and then come back later. You will no longer lose the current tool placement and configuration.
- Added a `Ctrl + RightClick` shortcut to dismiss the current tool activation. this makes it a little bit easier to quickly go back to regular walling after using a Curvy Wall tool.
- You can now hold the `Alt` key while placing and moving the Ellipse and Rectangle tools to force them into being a perfect Circle and perfect Square.
- You can now hold the `Ctrl` key when first placing an Ellipse or Rectangle to have it interpret the start point as being the "center" of the ellipse or rectangle. Useful if you know where the center of a room is and just want to grow the wall tool out from there.
- You can now plot points along a Quadratic curve, a Circle, and a Rectangle to generate the placement tool.
- Fixed an issue where moving a wall while a tool was placed would break the tool.

## Release 2.1.1 (2021-03-23)
- Updated Hotkeys shim and added hard dependency for the library.
- Japanese Locale update courtesy of Touge, Brother Sharp.

## Release 2.1.0 (2021-03-18)
- Added soft-dependency on Library: DF Hotkeys using its new Shim.
- Spanish localization update courtesy of [José E. Lozano (Viriato139ac#0342)](https://github.com/lozalojo)

## Release 2.0.0 (2021-03-17)
- Fixed Memory Issues! I was not managing my PIXI graphics properly, but now it is much more efficient and no longer causes memory leaks.
- NEW! Rectangle Tool. You can now draw rectangles that allow you to increment/decrement the number of segments on each side.
- Fixed rounding error issue with Ellipse causing it to be missing a wall when using certain numbers of wall segments.

## Release 1.3.4 (2021-02-15)
- Potential fix for a randomly occurring error.
- Fixed the url for the Manifest+ Media Cover (was missing the image).

## Release 1.3.2/3 (2021-02-04)
- Implemented new release system for all Dragon Flagon modules.

## Release 1.3.1 (2021-02-03)
- Added Japanese translations, courtesy of Touge

## Release 1.3.0 (2021-01-28)
- Fixed issue plaguing some users where the buttons don't do anything. This was caused by some users having an older version of the Foundry Installation (even though they updated to 0.7.9). Unfortunately Electron did not always update correctly during Foundry updates, and was causing problems. The issue has been corrected to accommodate those users.
- Added Keyboard mapping of the `+` and `-` keys for incrementing and decrementing the number of wall segments.

## Release 1.2.1 (2021-01-24)
- Added Spanish localization, courtesy of [José E. Lozano (Viriato139ac#0342)](https://github.com/lozalojo)
- Fixed module manifest not allowing people to update to the latest version properly.

## Release 1.2.0 (2021-01-23)
- Added label to display the current angle snap of the Ellipse Tool.
- Added label to display the current number of line segments.
- Bug Fix: Extended Tool menu was not opening properly when switching tools. Would only work for which ever tool was first opened.

## Release 1.1.1 (2021-01-23)
- HOT FIX: Corrected issue with keyboard input getting messed up. Users had issues with Pause/Unpause of the game and other keyboard related issues.

## Release 1.1.0 (2021-01-22)

### General

- Added keyboard capture of the "Enter", "Delete", and "Backspace" keys. The "Enter" key will now apply the current wall curve (just like clicking the green checkmark). The "Delete" and "Backspace" keys will clear the current tool (just like clicking the red X button).
- Added French translations.
- Bug Fix: Right-Click cancelling of the current point drag will now return to its original position as expected instead of clearing the tool.

### Ellipse Tool
- Added button for toggling on/off closing the ellipse when slicing. This can be useful for making a circle with a flattened side.
- Added button for toggling off the small partial wall that is generated when the current slice does not line up with the end of a wall segment. This can be useful if you don't want the little bit of extra wall but the slicer handle snapping doesn't quite line up.
- Added 2 buttons, one for increasing the snapping subdivisions, and the other to decrease it. This will provide the following angle snap sizes:
```
	   45°	(8 steps around the circle)
	   30°	(12 steps around the circle)
	   15°	(24 steps around the circle) ⇐ DEFAULT
	  7.5°	(48 steps around the circle)
	 3.75°	(96 steps around the circle)
```

### Cubic Bezier

- Added button for decoupling the line ends from the control handles. You can toggle it off and move the line end without the curve handle following.
