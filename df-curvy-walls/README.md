# DragonFlagon Curvy Walls

![Curvy Walls Banner](../.assets/df-curvy-walls-banner.png)

Adds Bezier Curves and Ellipse tools to the walls layer. This gives you the ability to generate wall segments along a curve quickly and easily. You can also increase or decrease the number of wall segments used along the curve.

## Bezier Curves

Supports both a Quadratic and Cubic curve to give differing forms of curve generation. The Quadratic curve may be of very niche use, but the Cubic is very powerful and will provide great ways to create "just the right" curve.

## Ellipse Curve

Generates a simple ellipse that can be squished and stretched. You can cut a "slice" out of the ellipse to create an opening, and you can specify the arc offset of the walls so the segments are position at the right point along the curve.
