		"GridlessPointResolutionHint": "How many points along each axis to generate for auto-targetting in gridless scenes (Example: for 3, there will be 3 x 3 = 9 points over each square). A higher number might cause slower performance with lots of tokens in a scene.",
		"GridlessPointPercentageName": "Auto-Target Gridless Percentage (Default: 0)",
		"GridlessPointPercentageHint": "What percentage of points need to be within the template for it to highlight them. Setting this to 0 means just one point needs to be inside to be targetted.",

			"MicroName": "Small Rotation Multiplier (Foundry Default: 3)",
			"MicroHint": "When holding Ctrl, you can perform smaller rotation snaps. This essentially multiplies the above setting by this amount to generate a sub-set of angle snaps. Setting this to 1 effectively disables micro angle steps."
