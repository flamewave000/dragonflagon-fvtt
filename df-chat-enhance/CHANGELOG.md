- Fixed Archive Name and Visibility not saving correctly.

## Release 3.0.1 (2021-03-26)
- Hotfix: New data storage solution for Chat Archive had a couple hiccups. Should be fixed now. Thanks to [hmqgg](https://github.com/hmqgg) for making a swift fix for the issue.

## Release 3.0.0 (2021-03-24)

## Release 2.1.0 (2021-03-11)
- Added Portuguese (Brazil) localisations courtesy of [Brn086](https://github.com/Brn086) and [Matheus Clemente](https://github.com/mclemente)
- Added sort option to Adventure Log so you can invert the direction of the line items.
- Added the ability to print a chat archive.
- Added cancel button to the Chat Edit window, for a clearer way to back out of an accidental edit.

## Release 2.0.0 (2021-02-20)
- Adventure Log
	- You can now right-click chats to add them as an event/quote to the adventure Log.
	- NEW! `/gmlog` command. You can now configure a GM Only log, separate from the general Adventure Log. This way you can make private note taking directly from the chat log without revealing the events to your players. This was sort of possible before by setting your settings in a certain way, but this is definitely simpler and a nice way to have both options.
- Chat Archive
	- GMs can now set the player visibility of Chat Archives. This will allow players to view chat archives the GM has allowed them to see.
	- GMs can now delete individual messages in Chat Archives.
	- Archive Merging! You can now merge other archives into the one currently being viewed!
- Chat Editing
	- You can now select the text in the "Original Message" area.
	- NEW! Shift-Up keyboard combo to edit your last sent message. Simply press and hold Shift, then press the Up key and release. This keyboard shortcut will immediately display the edit message dialog for the most recent chat message you sent.
- Roll Type Buttons: Adjusted colours to be more pleasing to the eye (Yes this is subjective, but what're you gunna do about it!?). Don't worry, I've also tried to use only Accessible Colours for our colour impaired friends in the community ðŸ™‚ Each colour should be visually distinct from each other and be within the AA specifications.
