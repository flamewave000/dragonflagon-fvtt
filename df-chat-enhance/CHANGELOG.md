## Release 3.4.0 (2021-11-09)
- **NEW #102:** Chat Color: You can now specify a custom colour for Chat Messages in the User Configuration. This is great for adjusting the tint slightly if the regular colour does not show up well.
- **NEW #102:** Chat Message Background: You can now tint the backgrounds of chat messages. This works the same as the feature in Chat Portraits and does not conflict, but will use the new custom chat colour if available.
- **NEW #66:** Adventure Logs: Can now use the timestamp generated by [SimpleCalendar](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar).
- **NEW #66:** Adventure Logs: Option to exclude the time from the log entries and used just the date.
- **NEW #198:** Chat Archive Manager can now be sorted.
- **NEW #175:** Chat Archive Message List can now be downloaded as raw HTML, along with CSS classes and inline-styles still in place. This can allow someone to style them however they wish for easy viewing outside of the FoundryVTT program.
- **NEW #185:** Chat Merge now merges messages in the Archive Viewer and in the Popout Chat Log.
- **FIX #189:** Chat Merge was causing some errors on a rare occasions when large numbers of chats are deleted.

## Release 3.3.0 (2021-08-26)
- Korean Localization: Courtesy of [drdwing](https://github.com/drdwing).
- Updated supported Foundry version to 0.8.9.
- Added #132: You can now select the directory for storing Chat Archives.
- Added #167: Merged messages will now default group by Speaker instead of by User. This can be toggled off in the module settings.
- Added #160: Whispers with many recipients will now truncate and display a "(+4 more)" label. Hovering the visible names will show the hidden ones.
- Added #163: Text selection of "formatted" chat messages.
- Updated: The Chat Edit feature has been moved. Instead of an Edit button on each message, this has been moved to the Chat Message Context Menu which can be reached by right-clicking a chat message. This helps to declutter messages in the log.
- Fixed #177: Could not create archive if the chat-archive folder was not already created.
- Fixed #158: Chat Merging will now hide the Chat Portraits for all but the first message in each group.
- Fixed: Chat Portrait CSS conflicted with Chat Merge's header adjustments and made delete button misaligned.

## Release 3.2.0 (2021-06-29)
- Chat Edit: Added option to ignore messages containing HTML from being editable. This will be on by default, but can be turned off to allow editing those messages.
- Chat Merge: Added whole new Chat Merging feature. This will merge chats in the chat log that were sent by the same person within a short period of time.
- Better Scrolling: Added new feature to provide better chat log scrolling. Including a new button for quickly scrolling to bottom, and preventing the auto-scroll from happening when messages are posted. So you can continue searching for that message from an hour ago without getting interrupted by a player doing a roll.

## Release 3.0.1 (2021-03-26)

## Release 3.0.0 (2021-03-24)

## Release 2.1.0 (2021-03-11)

## Release 2.0.0 (2021-02-20)
- Adventure Log
	- You can now right-click chats to add them as an event/quote to the adventure Log.
	- NEW! `/gmlog` command. You can now configure a GM Only log, separate from the general Adventure Log. This way you can make private note taking directly from the chat log without revealing the events to your players. This was sort of possible before by setting your settings in a certain way, but this is definitely simpler and a nice way to have both options.
- Chat Archive
	- GMs can now set the player visibility of Chat Archives. This will allow players to view chat archives the GM has allowed them to see.
	- GMs can now delete individual messages in Chat Archives.
	- Archive Merging! You can now merge other archives into the one currently being viewed!
- Chat Editing
	- You can now select the text in the "Original Message" area.
	- NEW! Shift-Up keyboard combo to edit your last sent message. Simply press and hold Shift, then press the Up key and release. This keyboard shortcut will immediately display the edit message dialog for the most recent chat message you sent.
- Roll Type Buttons: Adjusted colours to be more pleasing to the eye (Yes this is subjective, but what're you gunna do about it!?). Don't worry, I've also tried to use only Accessible Colours for our colour impaired friends in the community ðŸ™‚ Each colour should be visually distinct from each other and be within the AA specifications.
