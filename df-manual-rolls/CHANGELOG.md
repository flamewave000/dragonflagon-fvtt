# DF Manual Rolls

## Release 1.2.1 (2021-03-06)
- Conflict: Quick Rolls on DnD5e systems. Work around has been made available.
- Work Around: Disable roll prompt flavour text (new setting added for this).

## Release 1.2.0 (2021-03-04)
- Fix: Minimum roll requests are now properly returned without prompting the user for a roll.
- Fix: "Manual Roll" Chat flags will now no longer appear on chat cards that contain **only** RNG rolls.
