# DragonFlagon Quality of Life

Adds various Quality of Life improvements. These are all small, light-weight, adjustments that didn't fit in my other larger modules that help work out some of the kinks in Core FoundryVTT.

## Quick Table Rolling

This is a very feature that adds a "Roll on the table" option to the context menu of RollTable entities. This allows you to roll the table without opening the Roll Table sheet and clicking the Roll button there.

## Auto-Focus Text Box When Creating Entities

When creating an Entity (Actors, Items, Tables, Scenes, Folders, etc.) this will auto-select the Name text box so you don't have to click it. Just open the dialog and start typing! This will also affect any generic dialog that contains a Text box in it.

## Custom Folder Text Colours

Folders for the various entities can have custom background colours, but sometimes that colour does not contrast well with the unchanging text colour. This feature allows you to customize the text colour as well.

## Better Toggle Styling

The toggle buttons in the scene controls have the same look for both Hovering over with the mouse as when they are toggled on. This is frustrating as you cannot tell if the button is on or off while the mouse is hovering over it. Also, the difference between active and inactive is too subtle and is not easy to discern at a glance. This feature adds a distinct deeper purple colouring to the toggle when it is toggled on.
