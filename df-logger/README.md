# DF User Login

Sends an OOC whisper to all users when someone logs in. These messages have a lifetime and will self-delete after a specified amount of time. These messages currently use the same quotes that are used by Discord for when a user joins a server. There is also a message sent when a user logs out of the game.

- **(GM Only) Only show messages to GM:** The whispers will only be seen by the GameMaster in the server.
- **(GM Only) Auto-Remove Messages:** The GM can turn off the auto-destruct feature so log messages are perminent.
- **(All) Auto-Remove Delay:** Users can set how long a message lives in their feed before it deletes itself.
- **(All) Don't show my own to me:** Users can have their login message show to others but not themselves.
