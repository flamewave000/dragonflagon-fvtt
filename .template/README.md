# DragonFlagon Quality of Life

Adds various Quality of Life improvements. These are all small, light-weight, adjustments that help work out some of the kinks in Core FoundryVTT.

## Quick Table Rolling

This is a very feature that adds a "Roll on the table" option to the context menu of RollTable entities. This allows you to roll the table without opening the Roll Table sheet and clicking the Roll button there.

## Auto-Focus Text Box When Creating Entities

When creating an Entity (Actors, Items, Tables, Scenes, Folders, etc.) this will auto-select the Name text box so you don't have to click it. Just open the dialog and start typing! This will also affect any generic dialog that contains a Text box in it.
