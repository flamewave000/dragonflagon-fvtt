# DF Settings Clarity

This simple module provides a measure of clarity to the module configurations. It adds a tag to the start of each module settings' name that indicates if it is a `world` (GM Only) or a `client` (Per User) setting. This is very useful for GM to know which settings the users can see, and which ones only the GM can see. Also it can help clear up confusion when the GM is helping a player setup their settings.
